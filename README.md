# (Ad)mission Possible

> The college application, demystified — and free, built for the first in their family.

A landing experience plus an interactive intake that turns a few questions
into a concrete plan — a recommended application pathway, a balanced starter
college list, and a study track — followed by a student dashboard.

## Overview

(Ad)mission Possible is a single-page app (migrated from a vanilla
multi-page site) that walks a student from a bold landing page through a
7-question intake and into a personalized plan and dashboard. The goal is to
make the application process legible for students who are navigating it
without a map.

The original vanilla implementation is preserved in git history (see the
`legacy/` directory before the migration commits).

## Home intro animation

The Home page opens with a full-screen **floating-image hero**
(`src/components/IntroFloat.tsx`): the headline _"Impossible is just a
deadline."_ sits centered while ~20 thumbnail images orbit it.

**Behaviour**

- **Scattered, never a grid** — tiles are placed by percentage coordinates
  across every quadrant, at three depth tiers (`far` / `mid` / `near`) that
  drive size, opacity, blur, z-index, and movement amount.
- **Load animation** — each image arrives from an exaggerated outer offset,
  fading and scaling into place on a staggered `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`.
- **Auto-play inward → outward** — a CSS animation drives a registered
  `@property --inward` custom property (no scrolling required). Tiles
  interpolate between an inward vector (clustered toward the headline) and an
  outward vector (dispersed), looping gently so the field breathes on its own.
- **Continuous drift** — each image has an independent looping float on a
  separate layer, so idle motion never fights the auto-drift transform.

**Three-layer composition** keeps transforms from colliding:

| Layer           | Owns                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `.itile`        | scatter position + auto drift |
| `.itile__inner` | continuous idle drift         |
| `.itile__media` | one-shot load arrival         |

**Performance & a11y** — only `transform` / `opacity` animate, `will-change`
is scoped to animated wrappers, far images lazy-load, and
`prefers-reduced-motion` disables drift in favour of a static fade-in. The
headline is always real text.

**Swapping in real photos** — drop files into `public/intro/` and update the
`IMAGES` array at the top of `IntroFloat.tsx`; positions and motion keep
working unchanged. The included `t1.svg`–`t8.svg` are brand-palette
placeholders.

---

## Founding team

The Home page has a **Founding team** section: three tilted orange cards
(`TeamCard.tsx`), each straightening and lifting on hover. Content lives in
`src/data/team.ts` (a single source of truth shared by the cards and the
profile pages), so a card and its page never drift apart.

Each card links to `/team/:slug`, rendering `TeamMember.tsx` — a "My story"
profile in Geist: a light heading, a three-column row (journey path /
narrative / a bold belief statement with a muted sub-paragraph), a wide hero
image, a row of pastel skill pills, and a "Back to Home" pill in the top-left.

**Swapping in real photos** — drop files into `public/team/` and update the
`photo` (card, 15:11) and `storyPhoto` (wide hero) paths in `team.ts`. The
`*.svg` files are brand-palette placeholders; real photos override them.

---

## The intake flow

`Get my plan` goes to `/router`, a 7-question intake. On the last step the
answers and the computed plan are saved to `sessionStorage` and the user is
sent to `/plan`; the plan's track toggle persists and is reflected on
`/dashboard`. Visiting `/plan` or `/dashboard` without intake redirects back
to the router. `computePlan()` maps answers to a pathway, a balanced
reach/target/likely list, and a track.

---

## Design system

- **Type** — Geist Mono (display) + Geist (`--display`, used on the team cards
  and profile pages) + Inter (body).
- **Palette**
  | Token           | Value     | Use                         |
  | --------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
  | `--bg`          | `#F5F2E0` | warm cream paper            |
  | `--ink`         | `#3A3A36` | text                        |
  | `--muted`       | `#6F6E68` | secondary text              |
  | `--accent`      | `#E8491D` | orange accent               |
  | `--accent-soft` | `#F26B43` | lighter orange (team cards) |
  | `--mint`        | `#9CE6A8` | mint accent                 |
  | `--card`        | `#FBFAF1` | surfaces                    |
  | `--hairline`    | `#C9C6BE` | rules / borders             |
- **Motion** — scroll-triggered reveals and rotating hairline "slashes",
  re-scanned on each route change (`IntersectionObserver` + visibility/timeout
  fallback), plus the Home intro animation above. All respect
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Icons** — `Icon.tsx` renders a name to either an inline freehand SVG or a
  supplied PNG via the `PNG_ICONS` map (menu, route, course, coaching, people,
  list, submit, apply, learn-write); the rest stay vector.

---

## Accessibility

- Skip link, `main` landmark, and visible focus styles.
- The menu dialog has dialog semantics and moves focus on open.
- Router options are keyboard-operable.
- All motion honours `prefers-reduced-motion`; decorative intro thumbnails use
  empty `alt` text.

---

## Testing & CI

Tests live next to the code they cover (`*.test.ts[x]`) and include
`computePlan` branch coverage, storage round-trips, component unit tests, and
an end-to-end intake-flow test (router → plan → dashboard). CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck, lint, format check, tests, and
build on every push and PR to `main`.

---

## Deployment

This is a client-routed SPA, so the host must serve `index.html` for every
path (preserving the old site's direct-URL behaviour). `vercel.json` does this
with a catch-all rewrite. On other static hosts, add the equivalent SPA
fallback (e.g. a `404.html` copy of `index.html` for GitHub Pages).
